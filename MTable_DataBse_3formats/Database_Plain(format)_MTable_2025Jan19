Under the tutelage of renowned chef Lai Yau Tim, Chong honed his skills and expertise. Descending from a long line of Cantonese cuisine masters, Lai was trained by the famed Guangdong chef Li Cai. Notably, Li Cai was the last disciple of Jiang Kong-yin, widely regarded as the “first man of the hundred Cantonese foods.”	6620662	Kenc@mtable.rest	f	2024-12-24 10:20:06+08
